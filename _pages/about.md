I am a medical imaging researcher at Champalimaud Foundation - Center for the Unknown's Clinical Computational Imaging 
Group. I am also Ph.D. student at Instituto Superior Técnico (Supervised by Prof. Mário Figueiredo). I work on medical 
image processing (Radiomics, Segmentation, Registration, Machine/Deep Learning, DICOM).

I was a medical imaging researcher at Vrije Universiteit Brussel working on development of OsiriX/Horos plugins and CLI 
tools.
